<!-- **Asynchronous JavaScript: Overview**
This module delves into asynchronous programming in JavaScript, a fundamental concept for building responsive and efficient web applications.

**Synchronous vs. Asynchronous: Understanding the Difference**
- Synchronous operations block the execution until the task completes.
- Asynchronous operations allow the program to continue while waiting for a task to finish.
- JavaScript's single-threaded nature can lead to unresponsiveness during synchronous tasks.

**Callbacks and Callback Hell: Challenges of Asynchronous Code**
- Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to asynchronous operations.
- Callback hell occurs when nested callbacks become hard to manage.
- It leads to poor code readability and maintenance issues.

**Introducing Promises: Handling Asynchronous Operations**
- Promises provide a cleaner way to manage asynchronous code.
- A promise represents the result of an asynchronous operation.
- Promises have states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.
- They help avoid callback hell and allow better error handling.

**Promises Basics: States and Methods**
- A promise starts in the pending state and transitions to fulfilled or rejected.
- `then()` handles the resolved state, while `catch()` handles rejections.
- Promises provide chaining for sequential asynchronous operations.

**Creating Promises: Constructing a Promise**
- Promises are constructed using the `Promise` constructor.
- The constructor takes an executor function with `resolve` and `reject` callbacks.
- Resolving or rejecting a promise triggers the corresponding handler.
- Promises help structure asynchronous code more intuitively.

**Chaining Promises: Handling Multiple Steps**
- Promises can be chained using multiple `then()` calls.
- Each `then()` can return a value or another promise.
- Chaining simplifies managing a sequence of asynchronous operations.
- Errors can be caught at the end of the chain using `catch()`.

**Handling Multiple Promises: Promise.all() and Promise.race()**
- `Promise.all([...])` waits for all promises to fulfill.
- It returns an array of fulfilled promises' results.
- `Promise.race([...])` resolves when the first promise fulfills or rejects.
- These methods manage multiple asynchronous operations simultaneously.

**Implementing Promises: Overview**
This article explores how to implement promise-based APIs, wrapping asynchronous operations, and effectively handling their success or failure.

**Implementing an alarm() API**
- We implement a promise-based alarm API named `alarm()`.
- The API takes a person's name and a delay in milliseconds.
- The `setTimeout()` API is utilized for implementing the alarm.
- The Promise constructor creates and returns a promise.
- The promise's executor function handles resolving or rejecting.

**Using the alarm() API**
- The `alarm()` API sets an alarm with a specified delay.
- The returned promise is managed using `then()` and `catch()`.
- Negative delay values result in promise rejection.
- The `async` and `await` keywords simplify asynchronous code using promises.

**Introducing Workers: Overview**
In this article, we explore web workers as a way to perform tasks in separate threads, enhancing application responsiveness.

**Worker Basics: Separate Execution Contexts**
- Web workers enable tasks in separate threads.
- Main thread and worker run in separate worlds, communicating through messages.
- Main thread remains responsive even when a worker is running.
- Shared variables can't be directly accessed due to concurrency risks.

**Types of Workers: Dedicated, Shared, Service**
- Dedicated workers are used by a single script instance.
- Shared workers can be shared by multiple scripts in different windows.
- Service workers act as proxy servers, caching resources for offline use.

**Using Web Workers: Communicating and Executing**
- Workers are created using the `Worker()` constructor.
- Messages are sent using `postMessage()` and received using event listeners.
- Dedicated workers handle tasks defined in a separate worker script.
- Shared and service workers have specific use cases in different scenarios. -->
